**PROJECT: HTML/CSS | Building the Google.com Homepage**

For this project, I built a clone of Google's homepage using the basic HTML and CSS skills outlined in The Odin Project's "Web Development 101" curriculum. This project presented a unique challenge: Since Google's code is both minified and script-laden, I had to reverse engineer the original page using a combination of Chrome's developer tools and HTML/CSS best practices. The end result is a page that not only looks similar to Google's default homepage, but also utilizes (reasonably) good coding and markup practices.
